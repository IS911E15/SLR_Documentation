Lean is a well regarded strategy in production and warehouse organisations.\Alexander{Source?} Hence, in recent years Lean has been adapted to the software industry. 
Lean Software Development is a strategy focusing on: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Eliminating waste
	\item Amplifying learning
	\item Late decisions
	\item Fast deliveries
	\item Team empowerment
	\item Including quality
	\item Big picture
\end{itemize}
These seven principles seek to improve the development process by increasing efficiency and quality.

\section{Purpose}
Given our limited knowledge we will conduct a systematic literature search.
This search has the purpose of creating an overview detailed enough to determine where Lean Software Development stands at this point in time and to shed light on where further research is needed.
