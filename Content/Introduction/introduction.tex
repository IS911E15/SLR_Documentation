\section{Purpose}
Given our limited knowledge we will conduct a systematic literature review.
This review has the purpose of creating an overview detailed enough to determine where Lean Software Development stands at this point in time and to shed light on where further research is needed. 



\section{Tools}
For this review we use the Literature Manager Zotero.
