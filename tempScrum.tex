\section{Scrum}
Scrum is currently one of the most used agile methodologies. According to the 9th \textit{State of Agileâ„¢ Survey} \citep{VersionOne}, 56\% of the companies that do agile development use Scrum and at least 16\% more use Scrum combined with something else.

The overall principles of Scrum were first introduced by \citet{Takeuchi1986}, formalised a few years later by Schwaber and Sutherland and it has since been refined into what it is today \citep{Schwaber}. They describe Scrum as a lightweight framework for managing complex product development. Scrum is organised by having a Scrum Team, with a number of predefined roles, which performs a number of events. The roles and events, based on the description by \citet{Schwaber}, are described below.
